> Congratulations on being a new Kuri owner!
>
> Kuri represents a 3+ year engineering effort- and labor of love- by the team of 
dedicated roboticists at Mayfield Robotics. Although the difficult decision was 
made to shut down the company, the team at Mayfield wanted Kuri’s legacy to 
live on in the form of a useful and fun educational tool for anyone interested 
in robotics.
>
> This website exists as a repository for all engineering documentation related 
to Kuri’s software and hardware. Mayfield Robotics designed Kuri as an adorable 
home robot who would autonomously wander your home and automatically capture 
video clips of life’s most precious moments. But by “opening up” Kuri’s 
software and allowing users to Secure Shell (SSH) into the robot, Mayfield has 
given owners the ability to view her ROS (Robot Operating System) interfaces, 
change parameters, add new modules, and change which modules are running. Kuri 
is equipped with robust computing power and a state-of-the-art sensor suite, 
providing you with the perfect robotics platform to experiment with and learn 
from.

> This repository was created by Mayfield Robotics but belongs to the entire 
robotics community, so please feel free to contribute your findings and keep 
Kuri’s legacy alive for the next generation of roboticists.

## Getting Started 
Before doing any development work on your Kuri, you’ll first need to download 
Kuri’s companion app for your mobile device and “onboard” (i.e. setup) your 
robot; the Kuri companion app will walk you through the onboarding process, and 
instructions are also available in this repository under the “Getting Started” 
section.

After onboarding your Kuri, check out the 
[Getting Started](/guides/getting-started) section of this repository for 
information on how to get up and running with Kuri developer/console access.
Kuri documentation is divided into 2 main sections, with relevant directories 
under each section
