# Dance on Demand
Dance on Demand is a state in which Kuri will automatically dance along to music that is playing through her speaker when a user requests she dances.

## Entering Dance on Demand
* Kuri is told "Play your favorite song" or "Play pancake robot"
* Kuri is told "Dance", "Party Time", "Let's Party", or "Dance with me"
 * If Kuri is playing danceable music, she starts dancing immediately
 * If Kuri is playing non-danceable music, she responds "Got It" and then dances if music plays within 5 minutes (Note: this is not easy to trigger currently)
 * If Kuri is not playing music, she plays Pancake Robot

## Exiting Dance on Demand
* After the music stops for 5 minutes, Kuri must be told to dance again
* Dance on Demand is interruptible by other commanded behavior
