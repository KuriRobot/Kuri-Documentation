# Kidnapped Event

The kidnapped event is a more severe version of the [picked-up event](picked_up.md).  There are times (such as in [onboarding](../onboarding.md)) when we
want to be sure the robot has been lifed up and moved.  This times used the kidnapped event instead of the [picked-up event](picked_up.md) because the picked-up event
can be accidentally triggered more easily (like when Kuri goes over a large bump)
